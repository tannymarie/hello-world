# hello-world
My first repository
Hello, my name is Tanya.  I am a registered nurse, and I want to possibly change career fields.  I am teaching myself HTML and CSS currenlty.  I am trying to take advantage of all the resources I can find that will help me learn web development. I definitely feel a challenge with teaching myself code, but I am having fun learning and I enjoy the challenge!
